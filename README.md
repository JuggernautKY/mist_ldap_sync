## How it works?
1. The script will retrieve all the LDAP/AD users that belong to a specific user group. It will only query for username and email attributes
2. The script will retrieve all the Mist Site or Org PPSK created for the configured SSID
3. The script will look for
  * PPSKs not tied to any users from the AD/LDAP. If any, it will delete the PPSK
  * Users without PPSK. If any it will create the PPSK.

4. If configured, the script will send the new PPSK to each user

5. If configured, the script will send a report with created/deleted PPSK to the administrator(s)

## How to use it?
1. Just install the dependencies manually or with the `requirements.txt` file. For example with `p√Æp -r requirements.txt`.
2. Then configure the `config.py` file.
3. And to finish start the script with `python mist_ldap_sync.py` or `python3 mist_ldap_sync.py` depending on your system

##  Curent Limitation
- If you have multiple sites, the script must be run for each site

## Configuration
### Script settings
Check the `example.env` file to know how to configure the script. You will have to create a `.env` file with the required settings.

By default, the script is looking for the `.env` file in its own directory. You can also pass the `.env` file location when running the script with the `-e` option (i.e. `python3 mist_psk_rotate.py -e <path to the env file>`).

You can use the `-c` option to check your configuration.

### Email template
**Any change in the `psk_template.html` is at your own risks!**

If you want to customize the email sent to the users, you can modify the `psk_template.html` file. It's basicaly a HTML file, but:
- Be sure to use double curly brackets "{{" and "}}" instead of single curly brackets for HTML
- The script will inject 3 information in the template:
  - `{0}` will be replaced by the logo image location. It must be published on a web server and reachable by the users' devices
  - `{1}` will be replaced by the user name
  - `{2}` will be replaced by the SSID name
  - `{3}` wll be replaced by the PPSK value
  - If QRcode is enabled, `{4}` wll be replaced by the QRCode information (i.e. "You can also scan the QRCode below to configure your device:")
  - If QRcode is enabled, `{5}` wll be replaced by the QRCode
